# How To Contribute

First of all, **thank you** for contributing to this application!

## Setup

    npm install -g grunt-cli
    npm install
    grunt

To run the server that auto-restarts when changes are made, run:

    grunt server

## Issues
Please file issues on the [GitHub issues list](https://github.com/meducation/flumen/issues) and give as much detail as possible.

## Features / Pull Requests

If you want a feature implemented, the best way to get it done is to submit a pull request that implements it. Please make sure it has tests.

You can run the tests with:

```
npm install -g jasmine-node
grunt test
```

If you've not contributed to a repository before - this is the accepted pattern to use:

1. Fork it (big button on Github at the top right)
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Make your changes (please add tests!)
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
6. Create new Pull Request on Github

Thank you again!
